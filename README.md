This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Documentation

### Pages

**Static Generation (Recommended)** : The HTML is generated at build time and will be reused on each request. To make a page use Static Generation, either export the page component, or export getStaticProps (and getStaticPaths if necessary). It's great for pages that can be pre-rendered ahead of a user's request. You can also use it with Client-side Rendering to bring in additional data.

**Server-side Rendering** : The HTML is generated on each request. To make a page use Server-side Rendering, export getServerSideProps. Because Server-side Rendering results in slower performance than Static Generation, use this only if absolutely necessary.

We have create some example pages :

- `about.js`
- `blog.js`
- `blog-ssr.js`
- `sitemap.js`
- `posts/[id].js`

### Data fetching

**getServerSideProps**

You should use getServerSideProps only if you need to render a page whose data must be fetched at request time. This could be due to the nature of the data or properties of the request (such as authorization headers or geo location). Pages using getServerSideProps will be server side rendered at request time and only be cached if cache-control headers are configured.

This approach works well for user dashboard pages, for example. Because a dashboard is a private, user-specific page, SEO is not relevant and the page doesnâ€™t need to be pre-rendered. The data is frequently updated, which requires request-time data fetching.

**getStaticProps**

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
